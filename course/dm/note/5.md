## 1. 计数原理 Counting Principles

### 1.1. 加法原理 The Sum Rule

**加法原理(the sum rule)**：If $S$ and $T$ are **不相交的(disjoint)** finite sets, then

$$
|S\cup T| = |S| +|T|
$$

### 1.2. 乘法原理 The Product Rule

**乘法原理(the product rule)**：If $S$ and $T$ are finite sets, then

$$
|S \times T| = |S| \times |T|
$$

Here $S \times T$ denotes the Cartesian product of sets $S$ and $T$.

### 1.3. 容斥原理 The Inclusion-Exclusion principle

**容斥原理(the inclusion-exclusion principle = subtraction rule)**：If $S$ and $T$ are finite sets, then

$$
|S\cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S\cap T|
$$
